### Add credentials to `.env`

Create a `.env` file in the IF project root directory. This is where you can store your prometheus authentication details if you use basic auth. Your `.env` file should look as follows:

```txt
PROMETHEUS_USERNAME: <your-prometheus-username>
PROMETHEUS_PASSWORD: <your-pormetheus-password>
```
